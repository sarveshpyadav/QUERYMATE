## Description :

- QUERYMATE is a tool that centers on developing an intelligent Question and Answering (QA) System that draws strength from a custom dataset, revolutionizing the way user's access and comprehend information. By training the model on carefully curated data, I aim to develop a solution that can understand context, extract relevant information, and identical responses to user queries. The primary objective of this project is to build an AI-powered model capable of understanding questions posed in natural language and extracting uniform answers from a given text corpus. 

- The motivation behind QUERYMATE stems from the ever-growing challenge of efficiently navigating to find information quickly in the huge amount of data. In the digital world, the internet has showered us with an abundance of information. There’s more knowledge out there, than we could have ever dreamed of. But, here’s the challenge - with this wealth of information, comes the difficulty of finding what we need, when we need it. We have all been there, trying questions into a search engine, hoping for straightforward answers but getting lost in a sea of links and articles that don’t quite hit the mark. Consider, for a moment, while doing research work, we often use resources like documents, official documentations, technical blogs, e-books, etc. to get a relevant answer for the questions that we have, on a particular data source. We, as learners, are usually recommended to read reference books for our academic subjects, which is good. However, there are times when we want quick and accurate answers. Even for that purpose, we have to thoroughly analyze the entire book, which contains a bit of lengthy content. This work is very time-consuming, and it drains our energy in reading irrelevant information. These common experiences have inspired the creation of QUERYMATE.
